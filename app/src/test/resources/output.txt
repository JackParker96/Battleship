Player A: You have ten ships that you are going to place on your board one by one.

First, you will place two submarines, which are 1x2 rectangles.
Next, you will place three destroyers, which are 1x3 rectangles.

To place a submarine or a destroyer, you will type the upper left coordinate for the ship,followed by H (for a horizontal orientation) or V (vertical).
For example, M4H would place a ship horizontally starting at M4 and going to the right.

Next, you will place three battleships, which are shaped like a T.
Battleships can have four different orientations: Up, Down, Left, or Right:

  b      bbb       b        b
 bbb      b       bb        bb
                   b        b

 UP      DOWN     LEFT      RIGHT

To specify where you want to place your battleships, first type the coordinate of the upper left corner of the smallest rectangle containing your ship
Then type either U, D, L, or R to specify the orientation

Finally, you will place two carriers that are shaped like a Z and can have the same four orienations as a battleship

  c       c        ccc     cccc
  c       cc     cccc     ccc
  cc      cc
  cc       c
   c       c

  UP     DOWN     LEFT     RIGHT

You should specify how you want to place a carrier in the same way as for battleships

Player B: You have ten ships that you are going to place on your board one by one.

First, you will place two submarines, which are 1x2 rectangles.
Next, you will place three destroyers, which are 1x3 rectangles.

To place a submarine or a destroyer, you will type the upper left coordinate for the ship,followed by H (for a horizontal orientation) or V (vertical).
For example, M4H would place a ship horizontally starting at M4 and going to the right.

Next, you will place three battleships, which are shaped like a T.
Battleships can have four different orientations: Up, Down, Left, or Right:

  b      bbb       b        b
 bbb      b       bb        bb
                   b        b

 UP      DOWN     LEFT      RIGHT

To specify where you want to place your battleships, first type the coordinate of the upper left corner of the smallest rectangle containing your ship
Then type either U, D, L, or R to specify the orientation

Finally, you will place two carriers that are shaped like a Z and can have the same four orienations as a battleship

  c       cc     cccc     ccc
  cc      cc
  cc       c
   c       c

  UP     DOWN     LEFT     RIGHT

You should specify how you want to place a carrier in the same way as for battleships
